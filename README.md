# turbESN
Echo State Network code (used in parts of the DeepTurb project of Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung). Relies on a pytorch backend. Inspired by the easyesn package (https://github.com/kalekiu/easyesn).

Supports fully autonomous and teacher forced ESN predictions. A hybrid of both methods, called semi-techer forcing, is also implemented (restricted use).

## Installation
In order to install the package just use `pip3 install turbESN`. Here you can find the current PyPi release https://pypi.org/project/turbESN/.

## Requirements
Stable for
- `python `>=  3.6.0
- `torch`  >= 1.8.1
- `numpy`  >= 1.20.1
- `h5py`   >= 2.10.0 


## Manual
A first basic introduction can be found in the notbeook`basic_tour.ipynb`.  This example uses data from the Lorenz '63 system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system).
